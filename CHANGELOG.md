# Changelog

All notable changes to **1C Agent Platform** are documented in this file.

The format is loosely based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/),
and the project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) starting
from `0.1.0`.

## 0.1.0 — initial public snapshot (in preparation)

This is the first publicly trackable snapshot of the project. The version
matches `pyproject.toml`. This entry will be finalised when the operator
makes the first meaningful commit at the end of Track B / Step 2.

### Closed before 0.1.0

- **Phases 1–6** — read MVP, write MVP, metadata changes, intelligence
  layer, product layer, industrialization & completion track.
  See `PROJECT-STATUS.md` for per-phase detail.
- **Parallel Track A — Full Real 1cv8-backed Write Path** — closed on
  Step 7. Real binary-backed write path
  (`/DumpConfigToFiles` / `/LoadConfigFromFiles` / `/UpdateDBCfg`) is
  proven on a reference stand. See
  `docs/runbooks/track-a-reference-stand-round-trip.md`.

### Registry invariant carried into 0.1.0

- `mcp-read-server` — 15 public tools.
- `mcp-write-server` — 25 public tools.
- `mcp-intelligence-server` — 16 public tools.

No MCP surface drift through Track A or Track B / Step 2.

### Honest constraints carried into 0.1.0

- DESIGNER credentials remain operator-managed and out-of-band; never
  stored in repository.
- Multi-version 1С smoke matrix not yet exercised — single-version
  evidence on `8.3.27.1859`.
- No production-grade MCP transport, no installer ecosystem
  (`.msi` / `.deb` / GUI wizard / signed distribution), no web-UI,
  no full enterprise super-set (SSO/RBAC, multi-tenant, secrets vault
  as a service, federated audit storage, policy-as-code DSL,
  multi-instance HA).
- No hot reload, no OS-level service supervision, no full AST parser,
  no full rollback/delete coverage.

These are honest constraints, not hidden gaps.

### In progress

- **Parallel Track B — Productization & Delivery Polish** — Step 1
  (planning) closed. Step 2 (this entry: `git init`, `.gitignore`
  expansion, legal/doc baseline) in progress. Steps 3–6 not yet
  opened.
